        At BarCamp, you don't have to be an expert to give a talk
      </div>

              You just have to be passionate.  At BarCamp, you won't find a predetermined speaker list or a line of suits passing out business cards.  What you will find is some shaggy dude in a t-shirt talking about the best practices in SEO, or a world traveler sharing their experiences.  BarCamp is a chance to nerwork, learn something new, and communicate what you're most passionate about.  Come one, come all.
